# 🚨 URGENT: Environment Variables Required

## Current Status

- ✅ Frontend is deployed and working
- ✅ CORS configuration is correct
- ❌ **API is failing due to missing environment variables**

## The Problem

The API endpoints are returning `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` because the required environment variables are not set in Vercel.

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click on**: `taskaura` project
3. **Navigate to**: Settings → Environment Variables
4. **Add these 4 variables**:

```
MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://Naresh:d0Zch35lT9YCIPiF@cluster0.wkpgkoa.mongodb.net/taskaura?retryWrites=true&w=majority

JWT_SECRET = taskaura-super-secret-jwt-key-2024-production-ready

NODE_ENV = production

JWT_EXPIRES_IN = 7d
```

**Important**: Set each variable for **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development** environments.

### Step 2: Redeploy After Setting Variables

After adding all environment variables, run:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## 🧪 Test Endpoints After Fix

Once environment variables are set, these should work:

1. **Simple Test**: https://taskaura.vercel.app/simple-test
2. **API Root**: https://taskaura.vercel.app/api
3. **Health Check**: https://taskaura.vercel.app/health
4. **Login**: https://taskaura.vercel.app/api/auth/login

## 🎯 Expected Results

After setting environment variables:

- ✅ No more CORS errors
- ✅ API endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ User authentication works
- ✅ User-specific data filtering works

## 📋 Verification Steps

1. Open browser console on https://taskaura.vercel.app
2. Try to register/login
3. Should see successful API calls instead of CORS errors
4. Each user should only see their own tasks

## 🔍 Current Issue Analysis

The error `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` indicates that the serverless functions are crashing before they can even handle CORS headers. This happens when:

1. ❌ `MONGODB_URI` is missing → Database connection fails
2. ❌ `JWT_SECRET` is missing → Authentication fails
3. ❌ Environment not properly configured

## 💡 Why This Happened

The frontend was trying to call API endpoints that were failing silently due to missing environment variables. The CORS error was a symptom, not the root cause.

---

**🚨 CRITICAL**: The application will not work until environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard.
