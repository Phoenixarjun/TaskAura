## 🧠 Behind the Build

This project is a part of my journey with Nxtwave’s Full Stack 4.0 program, combining hands-on practice with real-world design thinking. I’ve built 20+ projects using React, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, and Express.js, and TaskAura reflects my vision of how productivity tools should feel — fluid, focused, and motivating.
